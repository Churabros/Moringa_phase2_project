#Overview
In the evolving landscape of the entertainment industry, major companies are increasingly investing in original video content to capture audience attention and secure market share. Following this trend, our company has decided to venture into the movie production business by establishing a new movie studio. However, given our lack of experience in this domain, it is crucial to understand the current dynamics of the box office to make informed decisions about the types of films to produce. This analysis will help our companyâ€™s new movie studio to strategically plan and create films that are more likely to perform well at the box office, thereby ensuring a competitive edge in the market.

# Business understanding
The film industry is a highly competitive and dynamic sector, where the success of a movie depends on various factors, including genre, budget, runtime,  and release timing. By analyzing these factors, we can gain insights into what makes a movie successful and use this knowledge to guide our production choices. Understanding the preferences and behaviors of moviegoers, as well as the strategies employed by successful films, will be critical in shaping our studio's content creation strategy.

#Objectives
1.	Identify leading movie genres in terms of gross sales to determine which consistently produce high-performing films.
2.	Compare production costs to revenue to identify optimal investment strategies for maximizing return on investment.
3.	Analyze movie ratings and audience preferences to understand what elements contribute to higher viewer satisfaction.
4.	Predict the best movie genres that return highest profit to the firm.
